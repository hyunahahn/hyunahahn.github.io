  <h2>Prosodic resolution of syntactic/semantic ambiguity in Korean psych-predicate constructions</h2>
  <p>In a sentence like "정연이가 무서운 가 봐요," is 정연 experiencing the psychological state of fear or is someone else (not mentioned in the sentence) fearing 정연? The former is called the 'experiencer reading' (where 정연 is the experiencer of the psychological state) and the latter is the 'stimulus reading' (where 정연 stimulates such psychological state in someone elese). My research shows that the two meanings of the ambiguous sentence are said with different prosodies. I initially explored only two different types of prosodic phrases (Acceptual Phrase and Intonational Phrase) in Ahn (2017). But in Ahn (2018), I digged deep into the full range of Korean prosody and showed that there can be four differnt prosodic phrases, and the mapping between prosody and syntax is intervened through the information structure of the discourse. My most recent paper on this topic (Ahn, 2020) used the same prosodic distinction as in Ahn (2017) to test English native speakers who learned Korean as a second language.</p>

  <p>Below is a collection of four different speakers on the same sentence using four different prosodies. Can you guess which prosody is for the experiencer reading and which is for the stimulus reading? Try and play all the four sound files, and guess which prosody has whicih meaning. The answer keys are on the bottom of this page.</p>

    <p>(1) The accentual phrase is a neutral one. It most commonly occurs with the experiencer reading, but it is quite compatible with the stimulus reading as well. (2) The focus intermediate phrase is most commonly used for the stimulus reading. (3) The syntactic intermediate phrase and (4) the Intonational Phrase never occur with the stimulus reading. Both are reserved for the experiencer reading.</p>
