  <h2>Definiteness defined as unique identifiability</h2>
  <p>Definiteness, most often marked with a definite article <i>the</i> in English, can be defined in many different ways. But probably most well-known and widely-used theories will be the givenness framework by Irene Heim and the unique identifiability framework by Bertrand Russell. In my studies, I used the latter framework to investigate how definiteness influences second language processing. <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0267658319868003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A self-paced reading study</a> was published in <i>Second Language Research</i> in January 2021, and an eye-tracking study is under way. </p>
