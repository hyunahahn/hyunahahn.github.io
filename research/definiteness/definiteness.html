  <h2>Definiteness definied as unique identifiability</h2>
  <p>Definiteness, most often marked with a definite article <i>the</i> in English, can be defined in many different ways. But probably most well-known and widely-used theories will be the givenness framework by Irene Heim and the unique identifiability framework by Bertrand Russell. In my studies, I used the latter framework to investigate how definiteness influences second language processing. A self-paced reading study was published in <i>Second Language Research</i> in January 2021, and an eye-tracking study is under way. </p>
	
	<p>Below is a short summary of the self-paced reading study, which is a modified replication of Clifton (2013). </p>
<ul>
	<li>(a) In the kitchen, Jason checked out <i>the</i> stove very carefully.</li>
	<li>(b) In the kitchen, Jason checked out <i>a</i> stove very carefully.</li>
	<li>(c) In the appliance store, Jason checked out <i>the</i> stove very carefully.</li>
	<li>(d) In the appliance store, Jason checked out <i>a</i> stove very carefully.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Among the four sentences, only (a) and (d) will be accepted as natural by most native speakers of English. The kitchen is a typical place where there is a single stove, which will be uniquely identifiable. When both the speaker and the listener share the presupposition that there is a uniquely identifiable entity, the definite article <i>the</i> is used. On the other hand, the appliance store is a typical place where there are multiple stoves displayed simultaneously; hence, without proper contexts, presupposing a uniquely identifiable stove in such an environment is infelicitous. Then, an indefinite article <i>a</i> makes better sense. </p>
