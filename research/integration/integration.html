  <h2>Real-time integration of linguistic and non-linguistic information</h2>
  <p>In the recent decades, many researchers investigated the role of real-world knowledgdge in sentence processing (Altmann & Kamide, 1999; 2007; Chambers et al., 2002; Kamide et al., 2003 among many others), and the research trend was part of efforts to present alternatives (roles of contexts, frequency of syntactic subcategorizations, semantic effects, prosody, visual contexts, and real-world knowledge) to theories in which syntactic information was assumed to be prioritized by parsers (Chomsky, 1965, 1981; Frazier, 1979, 1987).</p>

	<p>In second language sentence processing, real-world knowledge may play a different role from that in first language sentence processing due to its availability at the time of language acquisition. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263121000322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My new article</a> tested the hypothesis that L2 speakers' attemtps to minimize sentence processing costs could be a cause of discrepancies between L1 and L2 acquisition. Below is a brief summary of the two experiments in the article.</p>

	<h3>Experiment 1: Definiteness only</h3>
	<p>Now, consider Figure A. If you hear the incomplete sentence in 1 in the visual scene, which word would you predict the sentence would end with? There is no clear relationship between the person in the center and the objects in the four corners. That is, there is no real-world knowledge involved in Experiment 1.

	<ol type ="a">
		<li>The woman will want to buy the...</li>
		<li>The woman will want to buy a... </li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	L1 and advanced L2 participants mostly used the (in)definiteness information from the sentence to predict a referent. The only group that did not use definite and indefinite articles to predict unique and non-unique referents, respectively was intermediate L2 speakers. 
	</p>

	<h3>Experiment 2: Integration of definiteness and real-world knowledge</h3>
	<p>Now, consider Figure B alongside the auditory stimuli in 2. In this case, the doctor in the center guides your attention to the stethoscope rather than the laptops based on your real-world knowledge. In addition, the auditory stimuli also provide information with regard to the (in)definiteness of the noun phrase.

			<li>The man will want to use a stethoscope.</li>

</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>The man will want to use the laptop.</li>
			<li>The man will want to use a laptop.</li>

</ol>
			</li>
	</ol>
	This experiment resulted in very interesting findings. L1 speakers could use definitenes information in the presence of usable real-world knowledge. That is, they reacted faster to the grammatical sentence (2a) than to the ungrammtical sentence even when the sentence ended with what their real-world knowledge predicted (stethoscope). Their reaction times, however, were indistinguishable when the sentence deviated from their real-world knowledge based predictions (when the sentence ended with 'laptop.') 
	</p>
	<p>What is really interestng is advanced L2 speakers' behavior. They could use definiteness information to their advantage only when the sentence did not provide usable real-world knowledge. That is, when the sentence ended with 'stethoscope,' they did not make active use of articles to predict a referent; however, when the sentence ended with 'laptop,' they reacted faster to the grammatical sentence (3b) than to the ungrammatical counterpart (3a).</p>
