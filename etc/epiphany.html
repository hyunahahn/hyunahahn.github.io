  <h2>epiphanies</h2>
  <p>I'm not so sure if it is a good idea to start a whole new thread labled 'epiphanies' when there's no guarantee that I can make a 'list' where n > 1. But I sometimes come up with some brilliant ideas. So, I'll start the list with my all-time favorite and gradually add more stuff.</p>
	<ol><li>On folding laundry</li>
	<p> How do you feel about doing laundry? If you can rate your liking/disliking it on a Likert scale of 5, what would it be? In my case, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> doing laundry itself is OK. But I like it better if I can do it without running into anyone when I go back and forth between my desk (or any other spot I'm occupying while I'm doing laundry) and the washer.<br>
		<br>
		In graduate school, doing laundry was more cumbersome since I had to run into others when I walked downstairs from my room to the laundry room in the dormitory. Then, you have to smile at them, say hello, and ask how they are doing, etc. Then, all the thoughts you were having (how to code your R script, how to word that sentence in your paper, or how to curve the midterm of the course you're teaching) just dissipate into thin air.<br>
		<br>
		Back in Korea, I get to use my own washer and don't have to run into anyone (well, except my family) when I go back and forth between my desk and the washer. No need to distract myself from all the thoughts I'm having at the moment! So, I don't mind doing laundry that much. <br>
<br>		

The real headache of doing laundry, however, is "folding it" and especially "folding it neatly." Why should laundry be folded neatly in the first place? Why can't we just stack them flat on top of each other? Well, the question is of no use. Everyone loves neatly folded laundry (including me), although no one wants to fold them neatly. <br>
		<br>
		
Then, one day in my years in Honolulu, I realized that watching TV while folding laundry distracts me from the excruciating boredom of folding laundry! Have you all tried it? If you haven't, you should! I nearly forgot how I hated folding laundry.
