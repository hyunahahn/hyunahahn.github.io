<h3>Hero</h3>
	<p><b>By Mariah Carey</b></p>
<p>There's a hero if you look inside your heart <br>
You don't have to be afraid of what you are<br>
There's an answer if you reach into your soul<br>
And the sorrow that you know will melt away<br>
  </p>
  <p>
***And then a hero comes along with the strength to carry on<br>
And you cast your fears aside, and you know you can survive<br>
So when you feel like hope is gone, look inside you and be strong<br>
And you'll finally see the truth that a hero lies in you<br>
    </p>
  <p>
It's a long road when you face the world alone<br>
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold<br>
You can find love if you search within yourself<br>
And that emptiness you felt will disappear<br>
    </p>
  <p> ***<br> </p>
  <p>
Lord knows dreams are hard to follow<br>
But don't let anyone tear them away, hey yeah<br>
Hold on, there will be tomorrow<br>
In time you'll find the way<br>
</p>
