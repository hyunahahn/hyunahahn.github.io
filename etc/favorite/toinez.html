<p>
NAY, smile not at my sullen brow; <br>	
  Alas! I cannot smile again:	<br>	
Yet Heaven avert that ever thou	<br>	
  Shouldst weep, and haply weep in vain.<br>		
	</p>

	<p>
And dost thou ask, what secret woe	<br>	        
  I bear, corroding joy and youth?	<br>	
And wilt thou vainly seek to know	<br>	
  A pang ev’n thou must fail to soothe?	<br>	
 
	</p>
	
	<p>
It is not love, it is not hate,	<br>	
  Nor low Ambition’s honours lost,	  <br>	      
That bids me loathe my present state,	<br>	
  And fly from all I prized the most:	<br>	
	</p>
	<p>
It is that weariness which springs	<br>	
  From all I meet, or hear, or see:	<br>	
To me no pleasure beauty brings;	      <br>	  
  Thine eyes have scarce a charm for me.	<br>	
 </p>
	<p>
It is that settled, ceaseless gloom	<br>	
  The fabled Hebrew wanderer bore;	<br>	
That will not look beyond the tomb,	<br>	
  But cannot hope for rest before.	 <br>	       
 </p>
	<p>
<b>What Exile from himself can flee?	<br>	
  To zones, though more and more remote,<br>		
Still, still pursues, where-e’er I be,	<br>	
	The blight of life—the demon thought.</b>	<br>	
 </p>
	<p>
Yet others wrapt in pleasure seem,	      <br>	  
  And taste of all that I forsake;	<br>	
Oh! may they still of transport dream,	<br>	
  And ne’er, at least like me, awake!	<br>	
 </p>
	<p>
Through many a clime ’tis mine to go,	<br>	
  With many a retrospection curst;	       <br>	 
And all my solace is to know,	<br>	
  Whate’er betides, I’ve know the worst.	<br>	
 </p>
	<p>
What is that worst? Nay do no ask—	<br>	
  In pity from the search forbear;	<br>	
Smile on—nor venture to unmask	        <br>	
  Man’s heart, and view the Hell that’s there.	<br>
