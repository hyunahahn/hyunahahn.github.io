  <h2>Some brief notes on recent reads</h2>
	<ol><li>"Born a crime" by Trevor Noah</li>
	<p>The book is a vivid description of a comedian and show host Trevor Noah's childhood as a mixed child in the Apartheid in South Africa.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> I ordered the book through Kyobo sometime in December 2020, started reading probably sometime in February. I would read just a couple pages at a time. I wanted to read the book in the first place because I liked Noah's stand-up comedies. He is also a very talented story-teller, but to me, the book was never a page-turner. And I finally stopped reading the book when I finished it about 80%. I wondered why, then, I soon realized I couldn't read the book at a full speed for the same reason I had to take a semester's break on Chapter 5 of Harari's Sapiens and for the same reason I have to flip channels when news stories too painful to watch are aired. He describes with humor and composure his experience as a forbidden child in a country where a man and a woman of different ethnicities were not allowed to get married nor to have a child. Especially towards the end of the book are his life experiences as a young adult who could not find much support from anywhere. I believe the very last part of the book is about his mother and her abusive ex-husband. I just couldn't flip pages anymore. I'll write more when I finally finish the book.
