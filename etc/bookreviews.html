  <h2>Some brief notes on recent reads</h2>
	<p>[SPOILER ALERT] This page will probably just list books I recently read, am currently reading, and am planning to read (I'm thinking if I list books I bought, here on a webpage the whole world can watch, I might actually read them). And I have no intention to polish my writing too carefully, so I might accidentally reveal the contents that you might not want to know about before you read the books yourself. Please beware of those "read more" buttons.</p>

		<!--<li>"The emperor of all maladies: A biography of cancer" by Siddhartha Mukherjee</li>
		<p>The title sounded interesting. I'll write about it when I actually read it. Currently on my desk. </p>-->
		<li>7년의 밤 (25 Jul 2021)</li>
		<p>It was OK. I hope I don't sound too sarcastic, but it was really OK. But I don't think I'll read another book by the author. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> I have another copy of her novel on my desk, which my cousin kindly lent me, but I don't think I'll read it. I wonder if it's because of the way she develops her story going back and forth between an omniscient viewpoint and viewpoints of multiple characters. It was OK to kill time, but the problem was... I wasn't supposed to kill time. Maybe that guilt makes me hesitate to pick up another book of hers.</span><button class="read">read more</button> </p>
		<li>"The tyranny of merit" by Michael Sandel (25 Jul 2021)</li>
		<p>The book is about how meritocracy has become modern day's aristocracy. Unlike in the past where bloodlines were inherited, today, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> meritocrats inherit opportunities and environments through which their skills are honed and credentials are accumulated. One of the solutions he suggested was lottery admissions. As long as applicants meet certain standards, their names can be pulled out of a hat randomly rather than lining them all up with only miniscule differences. <br>
<br>
But that's not the whole point of the book. He raises an important issue of how we can keep human labor dignified. He cites what Martin Luther King Jr. once said about the importance of work by sanitation workers and that by doctors. He talks about why the working class whites voted for Trump, not just because their financial well-being was threatened, but also because they were losing opportunities to contribute to their society, their work was no longer dignified or respected by the society. <br>
<br>
After all that reading, I realized how jaded I was. I felt that he was too idealistic. His discussion of what's right or wrong or what's just and unjust somehow sounded too hollow. People will not be persuaded unless someone says "this is a smarter way to make everyone happy". Especially as technology advances, a lot of work previously done by humans is now being done by computers and machines, and maintaining the diginity of work has become a steep challenge for nearly everyone. I couldn't help but think relying on people's good will not solve the problem. This made me go back to a book I had left unfinished more than a year ago: Harari's 21 lessons for the 21st century. Stay tuned ;) </span><button class="read">read more</button></p>
		<li>"Justice" by Michael Sandel (25 Jul 2021)</li>
		<p>The book presents countless examples through which we can think about what justice is. Many philosophers and their philosophies <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> that existed only as names and titles for multipl-choice questions on high school ethics class exams (e.g., Bentham = Utilitarianism) are finally given meanings in relatable issues in daily life. I was especially impressed with Immanuel Kant's definition of "free will" (although I soon became disenchanted with his philosophy as I read his thoughts on sex, marriage, and lies).<br>
			<br>
			The author mentions three different strands of philosophy that can delineate justice: utilitarianism, libertarianism, and the pursuit of the common good. I was deeply impressed with the idea that a college admission is not a reward for one's efforts or merits, that a college should aim to contribute to the common good of the society, and that it should strive to meet the needs of the society. That insight led to the question of who can contribute to the common good of the society? To be specific, he says that recruiting the smartest high school graduates is not the aim of a university. A state university, for example, should strive to make sure that their graduates represent the ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic diversity of the society. Then, recruiting a racial minority with a slightly lower GPA than a white student is not a form of reverse discrimination. <br>
			<br>
			In the Korean society, I think we do not have enough conversations on who can contribute to the common good of the society, and what is needed to make sure that college graduates do make meaningful contributions to the common good.

		<li>"Born a crime" by Trevor Noah (9 Jun 2021)</li>
		<p>The book is a vivid description of a comedian and show host Trevor Noah's childhood as a mixed child during the Apartheid in South Africa.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> I ordered the book through Kyobo sometime in December 2020 and started it probably sometime this February, reading just a couple pages at a time. I wanted to read the book in the first place because I liked Noah's stand-up comedy. He is also a very talented story-teller, but to me, the book was never a page-turner. And I finally stopped reading the book when I finished about 80% of it. I wondered why; then, I soon realized I couldn't read the book at full speed for the same reason I had to take a semester's break on Chapter 5 of Harari's Sapiens and for the same reason I have to flip channels when news stories too painful to watch are aired. His stories are heart-breaking. He describes with humor and composure his experience as a forbidden child in a country where a man and a woman of different ethnicities were not allowed to get married nor to have a child. Towards the end of the book are his life experiences as a young adult who could not find much support from anywhere. I believe the very last part of the book is about his mother and her abusive ex-husband. I just couldn't turn pages anymore. I'll write more when I finally finish the book, I mean, if I ever do.</span><button class="read">read more</button></p>
