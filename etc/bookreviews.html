  <h2>Some brief notes on recent reads</h2>
	<p>[SPOILER ALERT] This page will probably just list books I recently read, am currently reading, and am planning to read (I'm thinking if I list books I bought on a webpage the whole world can watch, I might actually read them). And I have no intention to polish my writing too carefully, but it can still reveal the contents that you might not want to know about before you read them. Please beware before you click those "read more" buttons.</p>
	<ol><li>"Born a crime" by Trevor Noah</li>
	<p>The book is a vivid description of a comedian and show host Trevor Noah's childhood as a mixed child in the Apartheid in South Africa.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> I ordered the book through Kyobo sometime in December 2020, started reading probably sometime in February. I would read just a couple pages at a time. I wanted to read the book in the first place because I liked Noah's stand-up comedies. He is also a very talented story-teller, but to me, the book was never a page-turner. And I finally stopped reading the book when I finished it about 80%. I wondered why, then, I soon realized I couldn't read the book at a full speed for the same reason I had to take a semester's break on Chapter 5 of Harari's Sapiens and for the same reason I have to flip channels when news stories too painful to watch are aired. His stories are heart-breaking. He describes with humor and composure his experience as a forbidden child in a country where a man and a woman of different ethnicities were not allowed to get married nor to have a child. Especially towards the end of the book are his life experiences as a young adult who could not find much support from anywhere. I believe the very last part of the book is about his mother and her abusive ex-husband. I just couldn't flip pages anymore. I'll write more when I finally finish the book.

		<li>"Justice" by Michael Sandel</li>
	<p>Currently on p. 151. I'll write more when I finish the book. I'm reading this book about 10 pages a day during breaks on my daily morning walk. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The book presents a great number of easy-to-relate examples through which we can think about what justice is. Many philosophers and their philosophies that existed only as names and titles for multipl-choice questions on high school ethics class exams (e.g., Bentham = Utilitarianism) are finally given meanings in relatable issues in daily life. I was especially impressed with Immanuel Kant's definition of "free will" (although I soon became disenchanted with his philosophy as I read his thoughts on sex, marriage, and lies). I'll write more when I finished the book. </span>
<button class="read">read more</button></p>
		<li>"The tyranny of merit" by Michael Sandel</li>
		<p> I actually bought this book before 'Justice' and started reading it first. But it looks like I'll finish 'Justice' first. Currently on a break on p. 74.
		<li>"The emperor of all maladies: A biography of cancer" by Siddhartha Mukherjee</li>
		<p>The title sounded interesting. I'll write about it when I actually read it. Currently on my desk. </p>
