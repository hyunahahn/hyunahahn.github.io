  <h2>Favorite things from the past and the present</h2>
	<p><ol><li><a href="/favorite/toinez.html">To Inez</a></li>
	<p>I think it could be a bit misleading to list this poem as the first item on my list of favorite things. Well, first of all, I have never been a particularly literary person. Secondly, I did not<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">read this poem in English when I first fell in love with it as a 12-year-old girl. Technically, it was just a verse from the poem that I liked. <br>
		In the past when every little town had their own small mom and pop's bookstore, that is, before the era of the online mega bookstores, the small bookstores handed out small bookmarks to every customer who purchased a book from them. As a book-loving child who frequented the bookstore on my street, I had a huge stack of those bookmarks. They were laminated strips of papers with some drawings and words on them. Usually some proverbs or poem verses were found on them. Among all those bookmarks I had, my favorite was the one with the verse from "To Inez" by Lord George Gordon Byron. But like I said earlier, I was not a particularly literary person nor did I really understand Byron's poems at age 12.
