  <h2>My Favorite Things from the Past and the Present</h2>
	<ol><li><a href="../etc/favorite/toinez.html">To Inez</a></li>
	<p>I'm afraid it could be a bit misleading to list this poem as the first item on my list of favorite things. So, here are some disclaimers to begin with. Well, first of all, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">I am not particularly a literary person. Secondly, I did not read this poem in English when I first fell in love with a verse in it as a 12-year-old girl. Thirdly, it took me more than 20 years to find out from which poem of Byron's the verse came.<br>
<br>		
		In the past when every little town had a small mom and pop bookstore, that is, before the era of online mega bookstores, small bookstores in the neighborhood handed out bookmarks to every customer who purchased a book from them. As a book-loving child who frequented the bookstore on her street, I had a huge stack of those bookmarks. They were laminated paper strips with some drawings and words (usually some proverbs or poem verses) on them. Among all those bookmarks I had, my favorite was the one with a verse from "To Inez" by Lord George Gordon Byron. But on the bookmark was just one verse with the poet's name. I had no clue where the verse came from. Still, my 12-year-old self found anything melancholic just all so romantic. I memorized the verse by heart and remembered it for a long time. I thought it was beautiful. I remembered it in college, went to the school library, and tried to find the verse rummaging through many books that had Byron's name on them, well, to no avail. It was only when Google became a ubiquitous library at everyone's palm that I could finally find out where the verse came from. Now, my improved English will allow me to appreciate the rhymed words and some thoughts behind words, but even today, I cannot say I understand the poem to its proper depth.<br>
		<br>
		Well, I said favorite things 'from the past' and the present. So, I now find many things I found all so romantic as a child (or as a teenager) a bit too corny (Sorry, Lord Byron! You have no fault in this. It's just your words are not meant for any 12-year-olds. I hope you agree on that). Or time has just jaded me. It is a bit too embarrassing to confess that I liked such a melancholic verse as a sixth grader. But for some reason, I remembered the verse today and decided to share that little embarrassing part of my old self. So, here goes the Korean version. <br>
		<br>
		아무리 방황한들, 자기 자신에게서 도망칠 수 있을까? <br>
		제 아무리 먼 곳으로 도망쳐도 <br>
		놓치지 않고 쫓아오는 것은 <br>
		삶의 어두운 그림자, 생각이라는 악마<br>
		<br>
		The entire poem can be found if you click the title, and the Korean translation comes from the italicized verse.

		<p>Some songs are remembered with the accompaniment of episodic memories. This song is one of them. I vividly remember the day I listened to this song for the first time, what I was doing <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">when I heard the first phrase, and how I felt at the moment. I was cleaning my room as I inserted the cassette tape into the player (Do you know what a cassette tape is? Once upon a time when tigers used to smoke...). When the song began, I realized I could identify each and every word of the song. That was an amazing experience. As someone who was born and raised in Korea and made her frist trip to the U.S. in her third year in college, this was a remarkable moment! I can sing along an English song without reading the lyrics on the cover of the cassette tape case! Well, I know. It's because it was Mariah Carey not Eminem, but still... <br>
<br>
Even then, I was too excited about being able to hear every word  that I didn't pay much attention to the thoughts behind the words too much. It was only this spring that I happened to hear this song again on YouTube and got to appreciate the meaning of the song. Things were not going the way I was hoping for, and I felt weak to fulfill many of my duties. And the song comforted me saying that I could always find strength in myself that I could be my own hero.  Isn't it comforting to you too? We don't need to find a hero outside ourselves. And in the meantime, we don't need to be anybody else's hero. No one needs to be anybody else's hero. Everyone and anyone deserves love and respect without being a hero for someone else, without impressing anyone. I hope you find comfort in this song as much as I did. </span><button onclick="myFunction2()" id="myBtn2">Read more</button></p>
