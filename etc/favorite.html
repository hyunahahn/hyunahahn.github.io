  <h2>My Favorite Things from the Past and the Present</h2>
	<p><ol><li><a href="../etc/favorite/toinez.html">To Inez</a></li>
	<p>I'm afraid it could be a bit misleading to list this poem as the first item on my list of favorite things. So, here are some disclaimers to begin with. Well, first of all, I have not particularly been a literary person. Secondly, I did not<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> read this poem in English when I first fell in love with a verse in it as a 12-year-old girl. Thirdly, it took me more than 20 years to find out from which poem of Byron's the verse came.<br>
<br>		
		In the past when every little town had a small mom and pop bookstore, that is, before the era of online mega bookstores, the small bookstores in the neighborhood handed out bookmarks to every customer who purchased a book from them. As a book-loving child who frequented the bookstore on her street, I had a huge stack of those bookmarks. They were laminated paper strips with some drawings and words (usually some proverbs or poem verses) on them. Among all those bookmarks I had, my favorite was the one with the verse from "To Inez" by Lord George Gordon Byron. But on the bookmark was just one verse with the poet's name. I had no clue where the verse came from. Still, my 12-year-old self found anything melacholic just all so romantic. I memorized the verse by heart and remembered it for a long time. I thought it was beautiful. I remembered it in college, went to the school library, and tried to find the verse rummaging through many books that had Byron's name on them, well, to no avail. It was only when Google became a uniquitous library at everyone's palm that I could finally find out where the verse came from. Now, my improved English will allow me to appreciate the rhymed words and some thoughts behind words, but even today, I cannot say I understand the poem to its proper depth.<br>
		<br>
		Well, I said favorite things 'from the past' and the present. So, I now find many things I found all so romantic as a child (or as a teenager) unbearably cheesy (Sorry, Lord Byron! You have no fault in this. It's just your words are not meant for any 12-year-olds. I hope you agree on that). Or time has just jaded me. It is a bit too embarrassing to confess that I liked such a melacholic verse as a sixth grader. But for some reason, I remembered the verse today and decided to share that little embarrassing part of my old self. So, here goes the Korean version. <br>
		<br>
		아무리 방황한들, 자기 자신에게서 도망칠 수 있을까? <br>
		제 아무리 먼 곳으로 도망쳐도 <br>
		놓치지 않고 쫓아오는 것은 <br>
		삶의 어두운 그림자, 생각이라는 악마<br>
		<br>
		The entire poem can be found if you click the title, and the Korean translation comes from the italicized verse.
