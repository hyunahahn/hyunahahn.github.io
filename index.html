    <h2> Hyunah Ahn, Ph.D. </h2>
    <p> I am a researcher in psycholingusitics and applied psycholinguistics. <br>I conduct research on language phenomena that occur when Koreans <br>acquire English as a second language and when English speakers <br>acquire Korean as a second language.</p>
    <p>As I decided not to use a CSS file (for now) to build this page, I will <br>very slowly upload stuff mostly to help my students learn how to <br>use R and other experimental software. If you have <br>questions about my research and/or courses, please contact me at prosodygal at snu dot ac dot kr. Ciao niao! </p>
